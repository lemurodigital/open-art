OpenArt is a project to bridge the gaps between art and the open internet by developing tools and initiatives to make the history of art in the public domain easily available to developers, archivists, and educators.

In its nacency, this project's focus is creating tools to scrape and sort fine art files using python scraping and the [WikiArt API](https://www.wikiart.org/en/App/GetApi).
